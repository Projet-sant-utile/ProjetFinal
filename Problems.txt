Problems:

-City Hall have birthday, firstname and lastname. We should delete this from user and add only username. Add the other
attributes to Patient and HealthProfessional.
-City Hall can take a Office as an ID, it don't have a constraint to take only ID of Local.
-Office have a starting and a closing hours.
-Appointment don't have an ID for the locations.
